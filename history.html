            The San Antonio Spurs are an American professional basketball team based in San Antonio. The Spurs compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Southwest Division. The team plays its home games at AT&T Center in San Antonio.

The Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association (ABA) teams to remain intact in the NBA after the 1976 ABA–NBA merger[8][9] and are the only former ABA team to have won an NBA championship.[10] The franchise has won NBA championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014.[11] As of the 2022–23 season, the Spurs had the highest winning percentage among active NBA franchises.[12] As of May 2017, the Spurs had the best winning percentage of any franchise in the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada over the previous three decades.[13] From 1999–2000 to 2016–17, the Spurs won 50 games each season,[14] setting a record of 18 consecutive 50-win seasons.[15] In the 2018–19 season, the Spurs matched an NBA record for most consecutive playoff appearances with 22.[16] The team's recent success has coincided with the tenure of current head coach Gregg Popovich[11][17] and with the playing careers of Spurs icons David Robinson (1989–2003) and Tim Duncan (1997–2016). 
In the 2022-23 season, the Spurs celebrated the club's 50th anniversary.<br>

<p class="">Spurs players are active members of the San Antonio community, and many former Spurs are still active in San Antonio, including David Robinson with the Carver Academy[18] and George Gervin with the George Gervin Youth Center.[19]

    The Spurs set several NBA attendance records while playing at the Alamodome including the largest crowd ever for an NBA Finals game in 1999,[20] and the Spurs continue to sell out the smaller AT&T Center (formerly SBC Center) on a regular basis.
    
    Since 2003, the team has been forced into an extended road trip for much of February since the AT&T Center hosts the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo during that month. This is informally known as the "Rodeo Road Trip".[21] The Spurs have consistently posted winning road records during this period, including an NBA-record longest single road-trip winning streak (eight games out of nine, achieved in 2003).[22]
    
    When the Spurs have won the NBA title, the team's victory parades have been boat trips on the San Antonio River Walk.[23][24][25]</p>
